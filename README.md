### Time-varying DLNMs for the analysis of long-term temporal variations in health risks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An application of time-varying distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs), specified through an interaction between cross-basis variables and the time variable, to model temporal variations in exposure-lag-response associations between heat and mortality in a multi-country multi-city (MCC) data set. Specifically, this application illustrates how to model long-term variations, partly reproducing the analysis described in the article:

The code:

-   *regEngWales.csv* stores the daily time series data from 10 locations corresponding to regions of England and Wales in the period 1993--2006
-   the numbered files from *00.prepdata.R* to *05.plots.R* reproduce the results of an example with the subset of data
